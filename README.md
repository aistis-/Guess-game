Mini guess game
========================

A simple mini game based on Symfony 2.6.

No frond-end.

No security.

It is just a few hours implementation.

1. Config [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in your local machine
1. Mount your project root folder `cd local/path/to/your/project`
1. Start Vagrant VM `vagrant up` (it will take some time)
1. SSH to Vagrant `vagrant ssh`
1. Install dependencies via  composer `composer install`
1. Do not forget legit parameters. Use your local or on VM MySQL
1. Try to access `http://game.dev/`)
1. Expect it works
